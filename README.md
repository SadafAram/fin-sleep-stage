# Sleep Stage Classification with ViViT and Feature Imitation Networks (FIN)

## Introduction

This project focuses on sleep stage classification using deep learning techniques. We preprocess the PhysioNet dataset
to train a **Video Vision Transformer (ViViT)** model for classifying sleep stages. Additionally, we introduce **Feature
Imitation Networks (FIN)**, where we train separate models to estimate Shannon entropy and band power of a signal using
synthetic data. We then integrate FIN into ViViT and observe performance improvements.

### **Project Structure**

### **Methodology**

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
    - We process the **PhysioNet Sleep Dataset**, converting EEG signals from EDF format to structured NumPy arrays and
      CSV files.
    - Data is segmented into windows for training and saved in `data/3000/`.

2. **ViViT Model Training:**
    - We employ **Video Vision Transformer (ViViT)** to classify sleep stages using spectrogram representations of EEG
      signals.
    - The model is trained on processed PhysioNet data.

3. **Feature Imitation Networks (FIN):**
    - We create synthetic datasets and train separate models for **Shannon entropy estimation** and **band power
      detection**.
    - These models are trained using supervised learning with synthetic signal transformations.

4. **FIN Integration with ViViT:**
    - The trained entropy and band power models are incorporated as feature extractors into ViViT.
    - We fine-tune the integrated model and observe improvements in sleep stage classification accuracy.

## Installation

### **Step 1: Set Up Python Environment**

Ensure you have **Python 3.9** installed. You can create a virtual environment and activate it:

```bash
python3.9 -m venv sleep_env
source sleep_env/bin/activate  # For Linux/macOS
sleep_env\Scripts\activate    # For Windows
```

### **Step 2: Install Dependencies**

Run the following command to install all required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Results & Observations

- The **ViViT model alone** achieves a strong baseline accuracy for sleep stage classification.
- **Integrating FIN** improves performance by leveraging entropy and band power features.
